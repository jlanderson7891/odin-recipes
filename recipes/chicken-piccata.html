    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 stick butter</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>3 medium lemons, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Slice chicken breasts horizontally to yield 4 pieces.
            Place breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and 
            pound to 1/4-inch thin. Place flour on a plate and 
            dredge each breast on both sides in flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Put 
            chicken into the skillet and season tops with salt and
            pepper. Turn when nicely browned, about 4 minutes, and
            season again. Cook second side until browned, about 
            minutes. Transfter breast to a plate, reserving skillet 
            dripping.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add wine and lemon juice to the skillet, stirring to
            scrape up any browned bits. Simmer to reduce and thicken
            sauce, about 5 minutes more. Add capers and pour sauce
            over chicken breasts on the plate. Sprinkle with parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>
